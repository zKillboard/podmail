## PodMail Î²

Podmail is a web application for accessing and sending in-game EVE Online EVEmails directly from your browser. Your EVEmail data is stored locally in your browser, meaning server admins cannot spy on your messages.

The long term goal of Podmail is to deliver an excellent experience for managing EVEmails that is comparable to modern web-based email clients.
